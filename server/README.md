# Getting Started

To start server:

First set up Mongo DB, for example you can use mongodb.com cloud for it. Then create .env file with these variables:

PORT=xxxx
MONGOCLUSTER=xxx
DATABASENAME=xxx
DBUSERNAME=xxx
DBPASSWORD=xxx

Put your credentials for the DB and the port number in .env instead of xxx

## Available Scripts
